Andrea and Michele’s Secret Plan

Andrea and Michele had always been inseparable. Ever since they met in college (or was it high school? Andrea could never remember), they had shared every adventure, every crazy idea, and—most importantly—every secret.

One evening, while sitting at their usual café, Michele leaned in and whispered, “Andrea, have you ever thought about just disappearing for a while?”

Andrea raised an eyebrow. “Disappearing? Like, running away?”

“Not running away,” Michele corrected. “More like… taking a break from everything.”

Andrea took a sip of coffee (which had gone cold by now) and stared at Michele. “And where exactly would we go?”

Michele grinned. “That’s the best part. Nowhere specific. Just a map, a car, and no plans.”

Andrea hesitated. It sounded tempting, but also completely reckless. “Michele, we have jobs, responsibilities… you know, adult things.”

“Exactly why we should do it,” Michele replied. “Come on, Andrea, when was the last time we did something spontaneous?”

Andrea sighed, looking at the city lights outside the window. Maybe Michele was right. Maybe they needed this.

The next morning, a single note was left on Andrea’s desk: “Gone exploring with Michele. Don’t wait up.”

And just like that, they were on the road—no destination, no deadlines, just Andrea, Michele, and the thrill of the unknown.
